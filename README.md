Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my skills and creativity through a custom-built website styled to look like a Firefox browser. Itâ€™s built from scratch using HTML and CSS, with more exciting features in the pipeline.
About the Project
This portfolio is designed to mimic the look and feel of a Firefox browser window, complete with a functional and aesthetic UI. It serves as a sandbox for me to experiment with web design and development while presenting my work in a unique, interactive way.
Features

    Firefox Browser Styling: A fully custom CSS design that replicates the Firefox interface.
    Responsive Layout: Works across devices (desktop-focused for now, with mobile enhancements planned).
    Lightweight: Built with pure HTML and CSSâ€”no frameworks, just clean code.

Tech Stack

    HTML: Structure and content.
    CSS: Styling, animations, and Firefox browser emulation.
